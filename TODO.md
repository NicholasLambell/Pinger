# Pinger

### Todo

- [ ] Ping Status Color Controls
    - [ ] UI to select between status color mode; Static, Dynamic, or Custom;
        - Static: Existing functionality of fixed range colors
        - Dynamic: Status color based off average ping for a given site; e.g. If average is 300ms then it will display
          green
        - Custom: Allows full customisation of ping ranges and colors
    - [ ] Code logic implementation of the above modes

- [ ] Alerts
    - [ ] UI per site to configure alerts under various circumstances. e.g. Error response, above average ping, or fixed threshold
        - Alert popup / display should make use of the site's chart color for easy identification
    - [ ] Code logic to implement above UI behaviours
